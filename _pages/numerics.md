# Numerics

I have always been mesmerized by how a computer could execute repetitive tasks for people.
I have thousand of bits of codes doing things here and there, most are written Python or C++. Still, the remarkable ones revolves around
subjects down below. 

### Mechanistic modeling & CFD

I develop codes that can reproduce **biological behaviors** (cell growth, metabolites accumulation, ...) and **couple them with full scale CFD** computation of bioreactors. This way it is possible to predict what would happen 
to each and every cells of the population and manipulate it. 

In addition, I apply my skills in mechanistic modeling and CFD to many other topics such as heat and mass transfer in porous/granular media.

### Statistics & Machine learning

Biology requires to **assess the statistical robustness** of the conclusions we draw from the 
data we generate. That is why I acquired skills in descriptive and **inferential statistics**. 

Machine learning was the obvious next step. Nowadays, biotechnology high throughput methods,
such as flow cytometry, and increasing HPC power make a lot a things possible. I apply machine learning
algorithms to three types of problem: 

* **Clustering** (unsupervised learning) - to identity a sub-population of cells

* **Spectrophotometric quantification** (supervized learning) - to lower analytic response time and better operate bioreactors

* **Data analysis** - to understand the underlying couplings within the data using non-linear models
