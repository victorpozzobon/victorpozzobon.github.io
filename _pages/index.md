# Welcome

### I am an habilitated PhD research scientist using numerical tools to investigate biotech' questions

My current research focuses on microalgae and their interaction with light within a photobioreactor.
More specifically, I am reproducing the whole system (cells, fluid motion, light field) numerically
and investigate how they interact. As member or the [Chair of Biotechnology of CentraleSup√©lec](http://www.chaire-biotechnologie.centralesupelec.fr/en)
, all this is done with a clear aim at optimizing biomass production, thus helping microalgal 
biotechnology to realize the full extend of its promises. 

Still, my investigations are not limited to this field. I also have actions with other microorganisms (e.g. yeasts), or 
on completely different topics, such as fixed beds characterization for classical chemical engineering. 

In previous life called PhD, I also investigated lignocellulosic biomass and concentrated solar power interaction. 
This topic was more heat and mass transfer focused. It was part of the [Labex Solstice](https://www.labex-solstice.fr/en/) and hosted by [RAPSODEE](https://www.imt-mines-albi.fr/fr/rapsodee). 
I deployed experiments and modelling in synergy to
gain further insights about the couplings at stake during this unconventional way to upgrade biomass. The main conclusions
were that, this combination is possible way to store solar into chemical energy.
