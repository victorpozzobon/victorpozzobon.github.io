# Welcome

### I am a habilitated Ph.D. research scientist using numerical tools to investigate biotech' questions

My current research focuses on microalgae and their interaction with light within a photobioreactor.
More specifically, I am reproducing the whole system (cells, fluid motion, light field) numerically
and investigate how they interact. As a member of the [Chair of Biotechnology of CentraleSup√©lec](http://www.chaire-biotechnologie.centralesupelec.fr/en), 
all this is done with a clear aim at optimizing biomass production, thus helping microalgal 
biotechnology to realize the full extent of its promises. 

Still, my investigations are not limited to this field. I also have actions with other microorganisms (e.g., yeasts) or 
completely different topics, such as fixed beds characterization for classical chemical engineering. 

In my previous life, called Ph.D., I also investigated lignocellulosic biomass and concentrated solar power interaction. 
This topic was more heat and mass transfer focused. It was part of the [Labex Solstice](https://www.labex-solstice.fr/en/) and hosted by [RAPSODEE](https://www.imt-mines-albi.fr/fr/rapsodee). 
I deployed experiments and modeling in synergy to
gain further insights about the couplings at stake during this unconventional way to upgrade biomass. The main conclusion
was that this combination is a possible way to store solar power into chemical energy.
