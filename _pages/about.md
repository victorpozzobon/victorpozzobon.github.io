# About me

I was born in France in the very late 80's and grew up in Lyon's area. After
highschool I went for an engineering degree, with a specialization in fluid 
mechanics, followed by a PhD in heat and mass transfer. 

I fell in love with science around my twenties. I like the 
neverending challenge it feeds me with. It is one of the only job
that offers you a considerable amount of freedom. A freedom I use to learn and 
try to improve myself. In one word, I feel so lucky to have a job I am 
passionate about. 

Apart from that, I am the average Joe. I like sport. I have played rugby for more than
10 years. What's left of it today is a daily resistance training routine and a run 
on the week-end. I also find cooking quite fun. Oh ... And there is 
walking, may seem strange for anyone not living in the Netherlands, but I got 
a few medals for that. 

### About this website

While I built some websites myself, I am not a professional Web developer.
Luckily I accidentally found this [one](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pauliacomi.github.com),
with a very permissive license and easy to host. It is only normal that I 
reference the people the credit should go to. 

Finally, getting all the content to fit in one page was trickier than I excepted.
