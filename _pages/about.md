# About me

I was born in France in the very late '80s and grew up in Lyon's area. After
highschool I went for an engineering degree, with a specialization in fluid 
mechanics, followed by a Ph.D. in heat and mass transfer. 

I fell in love with science around my twenties. I like the neverending challenge it feeds me with. 
It is one of the only jobs that offer you a considerable amount of freedom. 
A freedom I use to learn and try to improve myself. In a word, I feel so lucky to have a job I am passionate about. 

Apart from that, I am the average Joe. I like sport. I have played rugby for more than 10 years. What's left of it today is a daily resistance training routine and a run on the weekend. I also find cooking quite fun. Oh ... And there is walking, which may seem strange for anyone not living in the Netherlands, but I got a few medals for that. 

### About this website

While I built some websites myself, I am not a professional Web developer.
Luckily I accidentally found this [one](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pauliacomi.github.com),
with a very permissive license and easy to host. It is only normal that I 
reference the people the credit should go to. 

**Would you like to know more, do not hesitate to contact me.**

### Lifelong learning

Lifelong learning is a great opportunity offered by the Internet. 
I take advantage of it and engage in MOOCs on a regular basis. 
They revolve around everything from cooking to statistics. 
If you like my opinion on any MOOCs I completed (some links may be dead, sorry), do not hesitate to send me an email.
