# About me

I was born in France in the very late 80's and grew up in Lyon's area. After
highschool I went for an engineering degree, with a specialization in fluid 
mechanics, followed by a PhD in heat and mass transfer. 

I fell in love with science around my twenties. What I like about it is the 
neverending challenge it feeds me with. It may also be one of the only field
that offers you this tremendous amount of freedom. A freedom to learn and improve
yourself to better find answers. I find myself lucky to have a job I am 
passionate about. 

Apart from that, I am the averaged Joe. I like sport. I have played rugby for more than
10 years. What's left of it today is a daily resistance training routine and a run 
on the week-end. I also find cooking quite fun. Oh ... And there is 
walking, may seem strange for anyone not living in the Netherlands, but I got 
a few medals for that. 

### About this website

While I build some websites myself, I am not a professional Web developer.
Luckily I accidentally found this [one](https://github.com/pauliacomi/pauliacomi.github.com),
with a very permissive licence and easy to host. It is only normal that I 
reference the people the credit should go to. 

Finally, getting all the content to fit in one page was more tricky than I excepted.
