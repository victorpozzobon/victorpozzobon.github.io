# Biotechnology

Since 2015, I have been working in a biotechnology lab. As I deeply believe that you cannot model something
you are not able to manipulate, I choose to get trained in biology. In addition to having acquired basic lab techniques, I 
now train people to use **flow cytometry** and carry out pulse amplitude modulated (**PAM**) fluorescence assays. 

Microalgae are my favorite microorganisms because of their photosynthetic ability (which makes everything more complex, hence fascinating).
But I also have experience with yeasts. 

### Aims

It is well-known that microalgal biotechnology large-scale deployment is hindered by three 
(four if you want to add strain optimization) bottlenecks: culture density - which is too low -,
harvest - which is endergonic -, disruption/extraction - hampered by millions of years of 
natural selection. Along those, I target culture density: in photoautotrophic mode by **increasing light use efficiency**, in chemioheterotophic mode by lowering substrate costs. 

### Projects

On the academic side, I investigate the **interaction between microalgae and light at the photobioreactor level**. While its exploration started a long time ago now, much remains
to be done. As for myself, I focus on biological behavior modeling and photobioreactor design. But I am far from restricting myself to these two fields.

I also lead projects with industrial partners. They usually revolve around photobioreactor performances assessment,
developing culture protocol for exotic microalgae, ...
